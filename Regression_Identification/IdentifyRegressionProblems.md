1. **Nature of the Target Variable:**
   - **Continuous Variable:** Regression is typically used when the target variable is continuous. For example, predicting house prices, temperature, sales, etc.
   - **Categorical Variable:** If the target variable is categorical, you might be looking at a classification problem rather than regression.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - **Histograms and Distributions:** Plot histograms or kernel density plots to visualize the distribution of the target variable. If it looks like a bell curve or has a continuous range, it's likely a regression problem.
   - **Summary Statistics:** Examine summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation to understand the central tendency and variability of the target variable.

3. **Scatter Plots:**
   - **Relationship with Predictors:** Create scatter plots for each predictor variable against the target variable. Look for patterns and trends. If there seems to be a continuous relationship, regression might be suitable.

4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - **Correlation Matrix:** Calculate and examine the correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables. High correlations between predictors and the target variable suggest regression might be appropriate.

5. **Problem Statement:**
   - **Understanding the Problem:** Clarify the problem you are trying to solve. If the goal is to predict a numeric value, it's likely a regression problem.

6. **Domain Knowledge:**
   - **Domain Expertise:** Consider domain-specific knowledge. If you know that the output variable should be a continuous quantity, it points toward a regression problem.

7. **Data Type:**
   - **Type of Data:** If you are dealing with time-series data or data with a continuous response variable, it often suggests regression. Time-series forecasting, for example, is a common regression application.

8. **Machine Learning Framework:**
   - **Algorithms Available:** Different machine learning algorithms are designed for specific types of problems. If you are using algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or support vector regression, you are likely working on a regression problem.

9. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - **Metrics Used:** The choice of evaluation metrics can also provide a clue. Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared are commonly associated with regression problems.

10. **Problem Description:**
    - **Problem Statement:** Review the problem statement or project requirements. If the goal is to predict a numeric outcome, it's likely a regression task.
