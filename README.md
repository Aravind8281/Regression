# Regression 
  
In machine learning, regression is a type of predictive modeling technique that analyzes the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to understand and predict the value of the dependent variable based on the input features. 
 
## Real-World Explanation 
  
Imagine predicting the price of a house based on various factors such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and neighborhood. Regression models can be applied to analyze historical data and make predictions about future house prices.

## Use Case 

**Predicting Stock Prices:** Utilize regression to forecast stock prices based on historical market data, helping investors make informed decisions.

## Topics Covered

- **Linear Regression:** Understand the fundamental linear relationship between variables.
- **Polynomial Regression:** Explore non-linear relationships using polynomial functions.
- **Regularized Regression (Ridge, Lasso):** Learn techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance model generalization.
- **Multivariate Regression:** Handle scenarios with multiple independent variables.
- **Time Series Regression:** Apply regression to time-dependent data for forecasting.

## Modules to Use

- **Scikit-Learn:** A powerful machine learning library for Python, providing easy-to-use regression algorithms.
