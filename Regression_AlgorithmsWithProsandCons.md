1. **Linear Regression:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Simple and easy to understand.
     - Fast training and prediction.
     - Provides coefficients that indicate feature importance.
   - **Cons:**
     - Assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
     - Sensitive to outliers.

2. **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):**
   - **Pros:**
     - Handles multicollinearity by adding regularization term.
     - Reduces the impact of irrelevant features.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires tuning of the regularization parameter.
     - Does not perform feature selection.

3. **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization):**
   - **Pros:**
     - Performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero.
     - Handles multicollinearity.
   - **Cons:**
     - May not work well with a large number of features.
     - Requires tuning of the regularization parameter.

4. **Elastic Net Regression:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Combines L1 and L2 regularization.
     - Balances the advantages of Ridge and Lasso.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires tuning of two regularization parameters.

5. **Decision Tree Regression:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Nonlinear relationships can be captured.
     - No need for feature scaling.
     - Handles both numerical and categorical data.
   - **Cons:**
     - Prone to overfitting, especially on small datasets.
     - Instability: small changes in data can lead to different tree structures.

6. **Random Forest Regression:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
     - Handles a large number of features and complex relationships.
     - Provides feature importance scores.
   - **Cons:**
     - May be computationally expensive.
     - Less interpretable than a single decision tree.

7. **Gradient Boosting Regression (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM):**
   - **Pros:**
     - High predictive accuracy.
     - Handles complex relationships and interactions.
     - Robust to outliers.
   - **Cons:**
     - More complex, requires tuning of hyperparameters.
     - May be sensitive to overfitting.

8. **Support Vector Regression:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
     - Robust to outliers.
     - Versatile due to different kernel functions.
   - **Cons:**
     - May require careful tuning of hyperparameters.
     - Memory-intensive for large datasets.

9. **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression:**
   - **Pros:**
     - No assumption about the underlying data distribution.
     - Simple and easy to understand.
   - **Cons:**
     - Sensitive to outliers.
     - Computationally expensive during prediction for large datasets.

10. **Huber Regression:**
    - **Pros:**
      - Robust to outliers.
      - Balances the advantages of Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error.
    - **Cons:**
      - Requires tuning of a hyperparameter
